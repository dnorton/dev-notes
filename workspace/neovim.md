## Kickstarter

[Kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)

This is a very small neovim configuration that let's you learn
as you go. You can always go back to LazyVim if you back up properly.

Some tips and tricks for out of the box Kickstarter:
(basic LSP functions)

- `:Telescope keymaps` - shows the keymaps for the Telescope plugin
- `gd` - go to definition
- `gr` - look for references
- `<Space>+d+s` - shows symbols in current file
- `<Space>s+f` - search files

## Plugins

- [go.nvim](https://github.com/ray-x/go.nvim)
