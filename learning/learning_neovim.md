## KeyMappings

Navigate around the buffers using the following key mappings:

- `Ctrl + h` - Move to the left buffer
- `Ctrl + l` - Move to the right buffer
- `Ctrl + j` - Move to the bottom buffer
- `Ctrl + k` - Move to the top buffer

- `[ + b` - Move to the left buffer
- `] + b` - Move to the right buffer

_Leader key commands_

- `<space> + f + b` - Open the file explorer
- `<space> + s + k` - Search key mappings
